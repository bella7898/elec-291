# ELEC 291 - Electrical Engineering Design Studio I
---
##Lab 1 - The N76E003 Microcontroller System  
- requirements: print name and student number
- additional features:
  - I built the chrome dino game, with scrolling background and custom characters for obstacle
  - scrolling feature simulates a 'multiplayer' idea in the first loading screen
  - jumping feature is possible with a button
  - score increments and is displayed on the game end screen, able to be incremented as well. 
##Lab 2 - Alarm Clock 2024
- requirements: functional clock and alarm, with buzzer
- additional features:
  - stopwatch mode counts up forever
  - you are able to save and display an old alarm
  - additional button is able to increment the alarm by 5 min
##Lab 3 - SPI Data Logging using Python
- requirements: send temperature data every 1 sec to the terminal, display a temperature strip chart using Python
- additional features:
  - color changing background based on the temperature crossing set temperature limits
  - crosshair lines detect the closest point on the real line when the mouse hovers on the chart, displays a (x, y) coordinate nearby
  - does a fast fourier transform and displays the smoothed purple line
  - calculates the line of best fit and displays that as a dashed red line
  - able to write the data to a .csv file
##Project 1 - Reflow Oven Controller
